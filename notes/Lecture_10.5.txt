Lecture 10.5 RTOS (FEB 23 2023)


Intro to the ESP32

Adafruit ESP32 Feather

240MHz Dual Core
520kb SRAM

4MByte Flash included
Tuned antenna

ESP32 Major Features

Processors:
 -CPU: Xtensa dual-core(or single core)
 - ultra low power
 
 
 
 peripheral interfaces
 
 UART for GPS
 
 PWM pulse width modulation (makes LED's brighter or dimmer)
 
 
 Networking and Structure of the Internet
 
 TCP/IP protocal family
 
 IP: Internet Protocal
   -UDP: user datagram protocol (pushing bytes out one at a time like a hose not reliable)
     -RTP, traceroute
   -TCP: Transmission Control Protocol (can lose bandwith, not as fast)
     - HTTP, FTP, ssh
     
What is an Internet?

 - A set of interconnected networks
 - The internet is the most famous example
 
 
Networks can be completely different
  - Ethernet, ATM, modem,...
  - (TCP)/IP is what links them
  - Routers (nodes) are devices on multiple networks that pass traffic between them
  - individual networks pass traffic from one router or endpoint to another
  - TCP/IP hides the details as much as possible.
  


ISO/OSI Network Model

Seven network "layers" (exam topic)

  - Layer 1: physical- cables *
  - layer 2: Data Link- ethernet (MAC Address) *
  - layer 3: Network - IP (Internet Layer/ IP addresses) *
  - layer 4: Transport- TCP/UDP (Packet transfer) *
  - layer 5: Session
  - layer 6: Presentation
  - layer 7: Application


ARP (address resolution protocol)


Packet Encapsulation
